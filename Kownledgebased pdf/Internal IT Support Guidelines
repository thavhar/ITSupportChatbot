Internal IT Support Guidelines
1. Device Usage:
Company laptops must be used strictly for business purposes. Installation of unauthorized
applications is not supported and may result in system compromise.
2. Support Hours:
IT Support operates Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST. For urgent issues outside
these hours, log a ticket via the IT portal.
3. Unauthorized Access:
Never share your login credentials. Violations will lead to immediate account suspension and
investigation.
4. Hardware Loss:
Report lost or stolen devices immediately to IT Security to prevent data breaches. A replacement
request can be initiated via the asset management system.
