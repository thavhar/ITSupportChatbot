You're looking to make your README even more impactful\! To achieve a "big title" and emphasize other points, Markdown uses **headings** and **bolding**. The largest heading is created with a single hash `#`, and subsequent headings get smaller with more hashes (`##`, `###`, etc.). For bold text, you wrap the text in double asterisks (`**text**`).

Here's how you can make your project title large and ensure other key points stand out, ready for you to paste:

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment Guide

Ready to get your IT Support Chatbot up and running? Follow these steps\!

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

  * An **AWS Account**
  * **AWS CLI** (configured with appropriate permissions) OR **AWS Console Access**
  * **Node.js** (for Lambda function runtime)
  * **Python 3** (for local HTTP server to host the frontend)

-----

### 1\. AWS DynamoDB Table Setup

This table will store all chatbot interactions.

1.  Navigate to **DynamoDB** in the AWS Console.
2.  Click **Create table**.
3.  Set **Table name**: `ChatbotUserQueries`
4.  Define **Partition key**: `sessionId` (String)
5.  *Optional but Recommended:* Define **Sort key**: `timestamp` (Number) for efficient querying of conversation history.
6.  Leave default settings for other options and **Create table**.

-----

### 2\. AWS SES (Simple Email Service) Setup

SES is used for sending escalation emails to your support team.

1.  Go to **SES** in the AWS Console.
2.  Navigate to **Verified identities**.
3.  **Verify your sender email address** (the email from which the escalation emails will be sent).
4.  If you are in **SES sandbox mode**, you will also need to verify the recipient email address(es) that the chatbot will send emails to. For production use, request to move out of sandbox mode.

-----

### 3\. AWS Lambda Functions

These functions power the core logic for escalation and data storage.

#### 3.1 Escalation Function (`escalateToHumanLambda`)

This function sends emails to human agents when the bot cannot resolve a query.

  * **Name**: `escalateToHumanLambda`
  * **Runtime**: `Node.js 18.x` (or a later supported version)
  * **Permissions**: Ensure the Lambda's execution role has the following IAM permissions:
      * `ses:SendEmail`
      * `ses:SendRawEmail`

*Code for `escalateToHumanLambda`:*

```javascript
// Example placeholder - Replace with your actual Lambda code
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const ses = new AWS.SES({ region: 'your-aws-region' }); // e.g., 'us-east-1'

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    try {
        const { userQuery, conversationHistory, userEmail, userName } = JSON.parse(event.body);

        const params = {
            Source: 'your-verified-sender-email@example.com', // Replace with your verified SES sender email
            Destination: {
                ToAddresses: ['your-support-team-email@example.com'] // Replace with support team email
            },
            Message: {
                Subject: {
                    Data: 'Chatbot Escalation: User Requires Human Support'
                },
                Body: {
                    Html: {
                        Data: `
                            <html>
                            <body>
                                <h3>IT Chatbot Escalation</h3>
                                <p>A user requires human assistance for the following query:</p>
                                <p><strong>User Query:</strong> ${userQuery}</p>
                                <p><strong>User Name:</strong> ${userName || 'N/A'}</p>
                                <p><strong>User Email:</strong> ${userEmail || 'N/A'}</p>
                                <hr>
                                <h4>Conversation History:</h4>
                                <pre>${JSON.stringify(conversationHistory, null, 2)}</pre>
                            </body>
                            </html>
                        `
                    }
                }
            }
        };

        await ses.sendEmail(params).promise();

        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Escalation email sent successfully!' }),
            headers: {
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', // Adjust for your frontend domain in production
                'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
                'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS,POST'
            }
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error sending escalation email:', error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Failed to send escalation email', error: error.message }),
            headers: {
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', // Adjust for your frontend domain in production
                'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
                'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS,POST'
            }
        };
    }
};
```

#### 3.2 Store Query Function (`storeUserQueryLambda`)

This function logs user queries and bot responses into DynamoDB.

  * **Name**: `storeUserQueryLambda`
  * **Runtime**: `Node.js 18.x` (or a later supported version)
  * **Permissions**: Ensure the Lambda's execution role has the following IAM permissions:
      * `dynamodb:PutItem` on the `arn:aws:dynamodb:your-aws-region:your-aws-account-id:table/ChatbotUserQueries` (Replace `your-aws-region` and `your-aws-account-id` with your actual values).

*Code for `storeUserQueryLambda`:*

```javascript
// Example placeholder - Replace with your actual Lambda code
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    try {
        const { sessionId, timestamp, userQuery, botResponse, confidenceScore, intentName } = JSON.parse(event.body);

        const params = {
            TableName: 'ChatbotUserQueries', // Your DynamoDB table name
            Item: {
                sessionId: sessionId,
                timestamp: timestamp,
                userQuery: userQuery,
                botResponse: botResponse,
                confidenceScore: confidenceScore,
                intentName: intentName,
                // Add any other relevant data you want to store
            }
        };

        await dynamodb.put(params).promise();

        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Query stored successfully!' }),
            headers: {
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', // Adjust for your frontend domain in production
                'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
                'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS,POST'
            }
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error storing user query:', error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Failed to store user query', error: error.message }),
            headers: {
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', // Adjust for your frontend domain in production
                'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
                'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS,POST'
            }
        };
    }
};
```

-----

### 4\. AWS API Gateway Setup

API Gateway exposes your Lambda functions as REST endpoints for the frontend.

  * Create two new **REST APIs** (or resources under a single API):
      * `/escalate` endpoint, configured to trigger `escalateToHumanLambda`.
      * `/store-query` endpoint, configured to trigger `storeUserQueryLambda`.
  * **Crucially, ensure:**
      * **Lambda Proxy integration** is enabled for both endpoints. This passes the entire request directly to your Lambda function.
      * **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is configured on both endpoints to allow requests from your frontend origin (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` during development, or your deployed domain).

-----

### 5\. AWS Cognito Identity Pool Setup

Cognito handles unauthenticated access for your frontend to interact with Lex and API Gateway.

1.  Navigate to **Cognito** in the AWS Console.
2.  Select **Identity pools** and **Create new identity pool**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., `ChatbotIdentityPool`).
4.  Under **Authentication providers**, expand **Unauthenticated identities** and check **Enable access to unauthenticated identities**.
5.  Click **Create Pool**.
6.  Cognito will create two roles (authenticated and unauthenticated). You will need to **edit the unauthenticated role** to attach the necessary permissions.
7.  Attach the following IAM permissions to the **unauthenticated role**:
      * `lexv2-runtime:RecognizeText` (allows calling the Lex bot)
      * `execute-api:Invoke` on your API Gateway endpoints (e.g., `arn:aws:execute-api:your-aws-region:your-aws-account-id:your-api-id/*/*`). Be specific with the ARN to restrict access only to your chatbot's API endpoints.

-----

### 6\. AWS Lex V2 Bot Setup

This is the core of your chatbot's conversational intelligence.

1.  Go to **Amazon Lex V2** in the AWS Console.
2.  **Create a new bot**.
3.  Define relevant **Intents**, including:
      * **`FallbackIntent`**: Configure this to trigger when Lex cannot understand the user's intent. This is where you can initiate the human escalation.
      * **`ThankYouIntent`**: For natural responses to user gratitude.
      * Other intents relevant to your IT support queries (e.g., `ResetPasswordIntent`, `CheckNetworkStatusIntent`).
4.  **Integrate an S3 knowledge base**: If you want the bot to answer questions from documents, configure a Knowledge Base within Lex, pointing it to an S3 bucket containing your IT guides (e.g., PDFs).
5.  **Build the bot** after making any changes.
6.  **Create an Alias** for your bot (e.g., `chatbotAlias`) and point it to the **Draft** version during development, or a specific version for production.

-----

### 7\. Frontend Deployment (HTML/JavaScript)

The user interface for your chatbot.

1.  Open your `index.html` file in a text editor.

2.  **Update the following placeholders** with your actual AWS resource details:

      * `Cognito IdentityPoolId`
      * `Lex Bot ID` and `Lex Bot Alias`
      * `API URLs` for your `/escalate` and `/store-query` endpoints (from API Gateway).

3.  **Serve the frontend locally** using a simple HTTP server (Python is convenient):

    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

4.  Open your web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

-----

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

Encountering issues? Here's a quick guide to common problems and their solutions:

| **Issue** | **Possible Cause & Fix** |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CORS Error** | Your browser is blocking requests. Ensure your **API Gateway has CORS enabled** for your frontend's origin (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). Also, ensure your frontend is served from an HTTP server. |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | This usually indicates a problem with your Lambda function. **Check CloudWatch Logs** for the specific Lambda function (`escalateToHumanLambda` or `storeUserQueryLambda`) to see detailed error messages. |
| **Unexpected Token Error** | Often occurs when API Gateway's **Lambda Proxy integration is not enabled**. Verify this setting in API Gateway for both `/escalate` and `/store-query` methods.       |
| **UI Elements Missing / JS not working** | Check your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors. Ensure HTML IDs match those referenced in your JavaScript, and that your JS runs after the DOM is fully loaded. |
| **Lex always escalates / doesn't answer questions** | Verify the **status of your Lex Knowledge Base**. Ensure your Lex bot is **built** and the **alias is pointed to the correct version** (e.g., `Draft`) that includes your intents and knowledge base configuration. |
| **New Lex intents not working / bot isn't learning** | After making **any changes to your Lex bot (intents, slots, prompts), you must explicitly Build the bot** for changes to take effect. Also, ensure your frontend is pointing to the correct Lex bot alias/version. |
| **SES Email not received** | Check your SES **Verified Identities** status. If in sandbox mode, ensure both sender and recipient emails are verified. Check your spam folder. Review CloudWatch logs for `escalateToHumanLambda` for SES-related errors. |
| **DynamoDB not storing data** | Check the **IAM permissions** for your `storeUserQueryLambda` function. It needs `dynamodb:PutItem` access to your `ChatbotUserQueries` table. Review CloudWatch logs for `storeUserQueryLambda`. |

-----

## 🖥️ Usage

Interacting with your new IT Support Chatbot is simple and intuitive:

1.  **Run your local server** (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`).
2.  **Open the chatbot page** in your web browser (`http://localhost:8000`).
3.  Start **asking IT support questions**\!
4.  The chatbot will attempt to answer using its knowledge base or, if unable, will **escalate the query via email** to your support team.
5.  All conversation turns are **automatically stored in DynamoDB** for your review.
6.  Feel free to **toggle dark mode** as desired for a comfortable viewing experience\!

-----

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

We're continuously looking to improve\! Here are some exciting enhancements planned for the future:

  * **Admin Dashboard for DynamoDB Logs**: A dedicated interface to easily view, filter, and analyze chatbot interactions.
  * **Multi-Turn Dialogues**: Improve conversational flow for more complex, multi-step queries.
  * **Sentiment Analysis (Amazon Comprehend)**: Integrate sentiment analysis to understand user emotions and prioritize urgent or frustrated interactions.
  * **Voice Integration (Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech)**: Allow users to interact with the bot using their voice for greater accessibility and convenience.
  * **Feedback Ratings for Responses**: Enable users to rate bot responses, providing direct feedback for continuous improvement.
  * **Richer Response Formatting**: Expand beyond basic text to include images, cards, and quick replies for more engaging interactions.
  * **CloudWatch Alerts for High Fallback Rates**: Proactive alerts when the bot frequently falls back to human escalation, indicating areas for knowledge base or intent improvement.
